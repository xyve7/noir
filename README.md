## Licensing 
Currently, this code is only my pet project, so **contributions are not welcome**.  

Due to the lack of a license, this code is **all rights reserved**, any usage of this code without explicit permission will be a violation of copyright law.  

In the future, I will be relicensing noir under a more permissive license, either AGPL/GPL or MIT/BSD/Apache.
